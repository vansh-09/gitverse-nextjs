# Cron Runner Setup

GitVerse uses a polling-based analysis job system. When a repository is queued for analysis, a runner must claim and process the job. This document explains how to configure that runner for different environments.

---

## How It Works

1. An API route (e.g. `POST /api/repositories/[id]/analyze`) enqueues an `AnalysisJob` in the database.
2. A runner calls `GET /api/internal/run-analysis` to claim and process one pending job.
3. Progress is written to the `analysis_jobs` table and polled via `GET /api/analysis-jobs/[id]`.

The endpoint `/api/internal/run-analysis` supports both `GET` and `POST`.
All requests require `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` when it is configured.
When no secret is configured, only Vercel Cron `GET` requests are authorized in production (identified via Vercel environment variables and `User-Agent`).

---

## Option A: Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended for Vercel deployments)

Vercel's built-in cron scheduler triggers your serverless function on a schedule — no separate worker process, no `git clone` required.

### 1. Add the cron to `vercel.json`

Include `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` as a query parameter in the cron path so the endpoint can authenticate the request:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/internal/run-analysis?secret=YOUR_ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET",
      "schedule": "* * * * *"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "app/api/internal/run-analysis/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 300
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Vercel cron jobs are only available on Pro and Enterprise plans. The free Hobby plan does not support them.

### 2. Set environment variables in Vercel

In **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` | A random secret string. Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`. In production, omitting it blocks normal manual/scripted access (except Vercel Cron GETs that pass Vercel UA/env checks). |

### How authentication works on Vercel

Vercel cron triggers send a plain `GET` request with the `User-Agent: vercel-cron/1.0` header. The endpoint authenticates via the `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` environment variable:

- If `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` is set: **every request must include it**, regardless of HTTP method or User-Agent. The Vercel cron path must include `?secret=VALUE` as shown above.
- If `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` is NOT set: only Vercel Cron GETs (identified by Vercel environment variables and User-Agent) are allowed in production. Manual/scripted calls return `401`.

For manual or scripted calls in production, provide the secret via header or query parameter:

```bash
# POST with header
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/internal/run-analysis \
  -H "x-analysis-runner-secret: YOUR_SECRET"

# GET with query param
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/internal/run-analysis?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

### Error handling

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No pending jobs | Returns `204 No Content` — safe to ignore |
| Job processing fails | Returns 500; job is re-queued until max attempts, then marked FAILED |
| Unauthorized request | Returns `401 Unauthorized` |
| Unhandled exception | Returns `500` with error message |

## Option B: GitHub Actions Cron (Free alternative)

If you are not on Vercel Pro, or you want a free scheduler, use the included GitHub Actions workflow. It runs every 5 minutes, checks out the repo, builds the worker, and runs it once.

### 1. The workflow file

The workflow is already included at `.github/workflows/run-analysis-cron.yml`:

```yaml
name: Run Analysis Worker
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'   # every 5 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:          # allows manual runs from the GitHub UI
jobs:
  run-worker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
      ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET }}
      GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      GITHUB_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_ID }}
      GITHUB_APP_SLUG: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_SLUG }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx prisma generate --schema "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/prisma/schema.prisma"
      - run: npm run build:worker
      - run: WORKER_ONCE=1 node dist-worker/scripts/analysisWorker.js
```

### 2. Add GitHub Actions secrets

In **GitHub → Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` | Must match the value set in your deployment |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Only needed if using GitHub App integration |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | Only needed if using GitHub App integration |
| `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` | Only needed if using GitHub App integration |

### 3. Trigger on demand

You can also trigger the worker immediately from another service (e.g. after a job is enqueued) using the `triggerAnalysisWorkerWorkflow` helper:

```ts
import { triggerAnalysisWorkerWorkflow } from "@/lib/services/analysisWorkerTriggerService";

await triggerAnalysisWorkerWorkflow();
// Uses GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_WORKFLOW_TOKEN, and GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE from env
```

Required environment variables for this:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REPOSITORY` | Your repo in `owner/repo` format |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` | A GitHub token with `Actions: write` permission |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE` | Workflow filename — defaults to `run-analysis-cron.yml` |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` | Branch to run on — defaults to `main` |

### Error handling

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No pending jobs | Worker exits cleanly with no output |
| Job fails | Re-queued until retries exhausted; then marked FAILED. Worker still exits 0... |
| Workflow dispatch fails | `triggerAnalysisWorkerWorkflow` throws — catch and handle in your calling code |
| Missing secrets | `getRequiredEnv` throws with the variable name clearly stated |

---

## Option C: Self-hosted / Docker

If you are running GitVerse on a VPS or with Docker, use the long-running worker process:

```bash
# Build the worker
npm run build:worker

# Run continuously (polls for jobs in a loop)
npm run worker

# Or run once and exit
WORKER_ONCE=1 node dist-worker/scripts/analysisWorker.js
```

Pair this with your OS scheduler (e.g. `cron`, `systemd`) or use `npm run worker:server` for the built-in polling server mode.

---

## Calling the endpoint manually

You can trigger a single job run directly via HTTP for testing or scripting:

```bash
# POST with secret in header
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/internal/run-analysis \
  -H "x-analysis-runner-secret: YOUR_SECRET"

# GET with secret in query string
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/internal/run-analysis?secret=YOUR_SECRET"
```

In local development with no `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` set, the endpoint is open:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/internal/run-analysis
```

---

## Environment variable reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANALYSIS_RUNNER_SECRET` | Recommended | Secures the `/api/internal/run-analysis` endpoint. When set, all requests must include it regardless of method or User-Agent. If omitted, only Vercel Cron GETs are allowed in production. |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REPOSITORY` | Option B only | Repo to dispatch workflow on, e.g. `myorg/gitverse-nextjs` |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` | Option B only | GitHub token with `Actions: write` |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FILE` | Option B only | Defaults to `run-analysis-cron.yml` |
| `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` | Option B only | Defaults to `main` |
